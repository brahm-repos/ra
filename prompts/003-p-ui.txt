I would like you to generate a ui using gradio as below

1. Title: HR Analyst Agnet 
2. Divide the screen into 2 parts. one part is left panel which should be 1/2 of the screen and second part os right panel other half.
3. Left Panel consists of 
    drop down named "Select JD" 
    dorpdown values come from the method ResumeAnalyzer.get_available_jds method.
    use the ResumeAnalyer instantiated in the main.py 
    When the user selects the JD from the dropdown, corresponding JD should be should be shown as link.
    When user clicks on the link, a model pane shows up with the contents of the JD.

    below these ui artifacts, there should be a button that says "Analyze"
    When the Analye button is clicked, execute router.analyze_jd(args.jd)
    once done, results are displayed in right side of the panel.
4. Right Panel consists of
    Right side of the panel displays the results of the result = router.analyze_jd(args.jd)
    as mentioned above. 
    it also would display the links to see the summary analysis of why matched and not matached.
    it should also have the link to down this analysis as md file.
